# HELP
Our webpage can be a bit peculiar to navigate, but worry not, help is here!
	
	- You can navigate interconencted pages using either arrows on the screen or arrowkeys
		- the arrowkeys might sometimes not work because of browser quirks. If that happens to you, just click into any empty space on the page and they should work again!
	- The project overview button returns you to the page with links to all the student projects.
	- The period overview  button returns you to the top page with links to all the period's projects.
	- From the period overview page, you can navigate upwards to explore more about the period as a whole.
